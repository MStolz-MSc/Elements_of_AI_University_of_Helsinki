Elements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an online platform created by the University of Helsinki and Reaktor. (Link: https://www.elementsofai.com/)
There are two courses about AI: Introduction of AI and Building AI.

Topics of Introduction of AI
- What is AI? (Definition, Applications, Philosophy)
- AI problem solving (Strategies, Games)
- Real world AI (Odds and probability, Bayes rule, Naive Bayes classification)
- Machine learning (Types of ML, nearest nneighbor classifier, Regression)
- Neural networks (Basics, structure, advanced NN techniques)
- Implications (Societal implications of AI, the future)

Topics of Building AI
- Getting started with AI (Why it matters, optimization, hill climbing)
- Dealing with uncertainty (Probability, Bayes Rule, Naive Bayes classifier)
- Machine learning (Linear regression, nearest neighbor, working with text, overfitting)
- Neural Networks (Logistic regression (LR), from LR to NN, Deep learning)
- Conclusion (Your AI idea)
